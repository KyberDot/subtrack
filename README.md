## Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  nexyo:
    build: .
    container_name: nexyo
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:3210:3000"
    environment:
      - NEXTAUTH_URL=${NEXTAUTH_URL}
      - NEXTAUTH_SECRET=${NEXTAUTH_SECRET}
      - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
      - DB_PATH=/data
    volumes:
      - nexyo_data:/data
    networks:
      - your-network

volumes:
  nexyo_data:
```

## Setup

### 1. Clone and configure

```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd nexyo
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://subs.yourdomain.com
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### 2. Build and run

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### 3. Create your account

Visit `http://localhost:3210/register` and create your first account.

### 4. Make yourself admin

```bash
docker exec -it nexyo node -e "const db=require('better-sqlite3')('/data/nexyo.db'); db.prepare(\"UPDATE users SET role='admin' WHERE email='your@email.com'\").run(); console.log('Done');"
```

## Nginx reverse proxy

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3210;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
}
```

## Migrating from SubTrack

If you were running the old SubTrack container, your data is fully compatible. The database file has been renamed from `subtrack.db` to `nexyo.db`. Run this once to migrate:

```bash
docker exec -it nexyo sh -c "cp /data/subtrack.db /data/nexyo.db 2>/dev/null && echo 'Migrated' || echo 'No old DB found'"
```

Then update your `docker-compose.yml` to use the new volume name `nexyo_data`.

## Data

SQLite database stored in a Docker volume at `/data/nexyo.db`. Survives container rebuilds.

## GitHub Actions (GHCR)

The included workflow builds and pushes to `ghcr.io/kyberdot/nexyo:latest` on every push to `main`.
